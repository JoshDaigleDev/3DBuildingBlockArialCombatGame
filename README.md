# Welcome to my Block Arial Combat Game..thing

This project was originally for one of my university courses, however I had a bit too much fun with it and now it has evolved quite a bit past the original scope of the project. This game features a fully 3D environment and character models, procedurally generated terrain, and dynamic collision detection, all done using [processing](https://processing.org/)! 

## INPUTS:
ENTER - Respawns the player, destroy all enemies, and reset the difficulty level.

SPACE - Fire your weapons.

w/a/s/d - Move player.

r - Switch between 3D perspective projection and 2D orthographic projection modes. 

p - Activate performance mode. This is useful if the textures are causing too much lag. It will reduce the amount of rendered background tiles and explosion projectiles spawned.
